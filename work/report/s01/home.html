                You should prepare yourself by installing the Lab & Development Environment (Links to an external site.). You should carry out the following work which leads you to a small website published on GitHub Pages. Working with Git and GitHub (Links to an external
                site.) Update my forked repo (Links to an external site.) Setup a website using GitHub Pages (Links to an external site.) Answer, or reflect upon, the following questions. Write freely, between 15 to 30 sentences. Did you before know about
                the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages? Have you ever created websites before? Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development. What is your TIL for this course section? Ensure you have pushed
                all your work to GitHub and attach a tag v1.0.0 or greater (v1.0.1, v1.0.2 and so on). Where should I write the text? For now, write your report in a text file work/report.txt and add it to your repo. In the next assignment we will move
                the text to a more proper place. What is a TIL? TIL is an acronym for "Today I Learned" which playfully indicates that there are always new things to learn, every day. You usually pick up things you have learned and where you might have
                hiked to a little extra about its usefulness or simplicity, or it was just a new lesson for the day that you want to note. Submission? You will submit this assignment, later on during the course. Save it for now by publishing it to GitHub.
                Grading? This will be graded at the end of the course, as U/3, as a part of all assignments.
