                I have some experience with github. I have been using Git and Github since i started this program 3 years ago. I find it a bit slow to use command line. I prefer using Github desktop. It sense all changes and you just have to commit and push.accept-policy.
                It the first time though that i am using github pages. It's totally new to me and i think it's really awesome. I did create a website before for one of our school project. And I'm actually working as an Intern for a Web Company. I have
                some months exeprience in frontend developemnt with VueJs framework. I love javascript and I try as much as possible to learn it. I also have some knowleges on Backend developement with Java and javascript. I'm also a big fan of GraphQl
                which uses a kind query language developed by facebook to build API. For this first lecture, I got to learn about Github pages and fork. I think theya re great tools offered by Github and i I will definately start to use it in my projects.

            <h2>S02</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately we havent done any HTML CSS and Javascript at school before this course. I wish I have discovered web development earlier in the program. But as I said above, I have caught the virus of Web developement and I using some tutorials,
                I learn a lot on my own. HTML is a 'language' responsible to describe the structure of Web pages. CSS is use to style html elements, to position them on a page, to produce some animation. JAVASCRIPT is a programming language use to bring
                life in a web page. It make a web page dynamic. 3) Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts. When browsing, users make requests to access some resources that are located somewhere in a
                server. Users then user browsers to issue http requests and user the browser to get requested data back. 4) What is your TIL for this course section? I must say that all was ok for me for this course section. I have to improve my CSS,HTML
                and JAVASCRIPT

            <h2>S03</h2>
            <p>As i said before, I made a client side web app for a a school project earlier. I had to connect to a remote server and do some CRUD operations. Besides, at work I'm dealing with clientside App. I have learned Java so far and i think JavaScript
                is somehow like Java or c#. But I like more Javascript so far. I think it's difficult as language but in the same time it think it's more complete that Java for exemple. It's also the most popular in Web deveolopment cercle. I should say
                that i am not very happy with my coding. I think there is a lot of code repetition but i don't know how to make it better. I'm use to work with framework like Vuejs or React. It make everything easy. Working from scratch like this is very
                good somehow because i think i learn a lot. But i just see that there are a lot of code duplication. A part from that i think proper coding was not that difficult yet. 4) What is your TIL for this course section? I got to learn about transitions
                and animations. And I worked hard to reduce code duplication.

            <h2>S04</h2>
            <p>I have use Node and Npm(Node packet namager) already in my projects. While creating VueJs projects or GraphQL I'm used to use NPM for manage my dependencies. I't feels quite normal for me to work with Javascript, Node and Express. I'm not
                used to EJS though and i find it a bit confusing because so far I was using Node just for Server side Apps. So it was quite difficult to solve the EJS part. I had to follow some Youtube tutorial and took inpiration from there to be able
                to finish. I should say that once i cook understand how everything works, It became simpler. And I'm really happy about the result. My friend and I have been having fun playing my Lottery game.

            <h2>S05</h2>
            <p>
                At the begining it was a bit confusing since i have no previous experience with PHP. Now that i have been practicing a bit, I think the difficult part is the set ups. Once everything is setup, it gets really smooth. I had the choice to use XAMPP which
                offer all the template but i decided to do it using the general PHP server. I thought it was better to be able to understand and organise my code the way i wanted. As a conclusion, I think PHP a very powerful language that offer great
                tools for dynamic websites. I understand why it still widely used out there in the industry. The PHP language itself seems not very difficult. I think one just need to get use to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would like to compare PHP with Javascript because they both are widely use in Web development. Both JavaScript and PHP are two of the most popular and versatile programming languages used for website development. Many programmers would agree it’s not
                fair to compare one with the other because they have different purposes when it comes to website development. While JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, PHP is the most popular server-side scripting language. JavaScript handles
                things on the browser side without going back to the server side, whereas PHP handles things at the server side. PHP is based on C language, so anyone with a decent knowledge of C would find PHP easy to master. While both are used to improve
                the functionality of websites, they have their fair share of pros and cons which definitely put one above the other.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was quite difficult at the beginning. After watching some tutorial, I started to find my way around. I manage to do all part and i aim for a 5 I so happy about this part because now i can set up and bild a web app with PHP. I did not know anything
                about PHP before ,So my TIL is the whole concept.

            <h2>S06</h2>
            <p>I think popularity among programming languages is quite subjective as it changing so fast nowaday. Some languages are more popular than other but at the end is a matter of preference. I really think it also depends on what you use the language
                for For example C will me more popular for game developer will Java or C# or Pyton or PHP will be more popular as server side language. Javascript will be popular in frondend developement. So i think the popularity is relative.
                <p>I just a beginner but i love javascript. So will definately go for Javascript in the future</p><br>
                <p><strong>Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com ,to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.</strong></p><br>
                <p>My comparison is that of JavaScript, PHP, Java. The results are parts of Europe such as Sweden, Norway, Brittain, France is the most popular language and in second place comes Java with and then the least is PHP not as popular as I thought
                    it would be. Some countries like USA, Italy, Germany, China is most popular with Java. While the only country with PHP being popular is Indonesia, the rest of the world are very popular with JavaScript and Java both being around 40-50%
                    each in these countries and PHP in the lesser than 10-20%.</p><br>
                <p><strong>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</strong></p>
                <p>It would definately be JavaScript as programming language. As i said before i love javascript. It's not the most simple language to learn but it's so powerful once you know. It's offer so many possibilities to bring live into your web
                    applications. I will recommend VueJs or React as framework. Personnaly i use VueJs because its quite simple to learn and it a good progressive language back up by big structures like Facebook,GitLab, Amazon...</p><br>

            <p><strong>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</strong><br> ASP.NET is a programming platform that provides a framework to many programming languages but more used for
                C#. The platform offers template for server side and client side web apps using MVC models.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</strong><br> .Net is very big and have alot of functionality. The MVC is implemented in both Express and .Net asp but asp is much nicer
                and userfriendly.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</strong><br> I did not have much experience with .NET before but since C# is quite like Java, i could find my ways around
                after some reading and stackoverflow researchs. I could not do all parts because of lack of time. I Aim for a 4

            <h2>S09</h2>
            <p>Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, from your own experience, related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP top ten.</p>
            <p>In my past experiences in development of programs. I have learned that never to use statements but preparedstatements instead. Also making to hash and salt the user credentials for authentication to be kept safe. Then avoid having backdoors
                that people can abuse. So for these I would relate to OSAWP 10 are: Injections, Broken authentication, Broken access control. So in testing and debugging in deveolpment I usually make easier ways of accessing database and programs but
                these ways can be harmful for final product so to have it removed is necessary becuase they are not safe.</p>

            <p>Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic “The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”.</p>
            <p>To avoid leaving sensitive data available by separating development and testing and production, which require certain privilegies or log in credentials. Also backdoors for files and source code such as leaving a sensitive project available
                on GitHub for anyone to find public. There should be an administrator for handling the system and not give more privilegies than needed for a normal user. And make sure that the error logs dont give out certain credentials for instance,
                accessing the database. Then also to keep dependencies and tools updated to avoid security flaws. Such as using the latest JDBC for MySQL in Java.</p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>My TIL is understanding a bit more of security flaws precented and how serious it can be like for instance having financial issues from being attacked by hackers and the outcome that is may have on customers dependent on your service and might
                in the future not be a customer from reasons like these. For instance Reddit was hacked before and had their DB exposed and it was found out that all the passwords and usernames where not encrypted at all but just in plain text.</p>
