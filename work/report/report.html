            <h2>S01</h2>
            <p>1) Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages? I have some experience with github. It the first time though that i am using github pages. 2) Have you ever created websites before? Yes i did create a
                website for one of our school project. 3) Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development. I have some months exeprience in frontend developemnt with VueJs framework. 4) What is your TIL for this course section?
                github pages.

            <h2>S02</h2>
            <p>1) Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript? yes a bit of experience. Unfortunately we havent done any at school before. So I learn a lot on my own. 2) Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.
                HTML is a 'language' responsible to describe the structure of Web pages. CSS is use to style html elements, to position them on a page, to produce some animation. JAVASCRIPT is a programming language use to bring life in a web page. It
                make a web page dynamic. 3) Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts. When browsing, users make requests to access some resources that are located somewhere in a server. Users then user
                browsers to issue http requests and user the browser to get requested data back. 4) What is your TIL for this course section? I must say that all was ok for me for this course section. I have to improve my CSS,HTML and JAVASCRIPT

            <h2>S03</h2>
            <p>1) Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript? Yes little bit. As i said before, I made a client side web app for a a school project earlier. I had to connect to a remote server and do some CRUD operations. 2) Can you compare
                and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know? I have learned Java so far and i think JavaScript is somehow like Java or c#. 3) Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did
                your code turn out to be? I should say that i am not very happy with my coding. I think there is a lot of code repetition but i don't know how to make it better. I'm use to work with framework like Vuejs or React. It make everything easy.
                Working from scratch like this is very good somehow because i think i learn a lot. But i just see that there are a lot of code duplication. A part from that i think proper coding was not that difficult yet. 4) What is your TIL for this
                course section? I got to learn about transitions and animations. And I worked hard to reduce code duplication.

                it should be ok. 3) Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work? 4) What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level? 5) What is your TIL for this course section?
