                <p>1) Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages? I have some experience with github. It the first time though that i am using github pages. 2) Have you ever created websites before? Yes i did create a
                    website for one of our school project. 3) Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development. I have some months exeprience in frontend developemnt with VueJs framework. 4) What is your TIL for this course section?
                    github pages.

                <p>1) Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript? yes a bit of experience. Unfortunately we havent done any at school before. So I learn a lot on my own. 2) Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.
                    HTML is a 'language' responsible to describe the structure of Web pages. CSS is use to style html elements, to position them on a page, to produce some animation. JAVASCRIPT is a programming language use to bring life in a web page. It
                    make a web page dynamic. 3) Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts. When browsing, users make requests to access some resources that are located somewhere in a server. Users then user
                    browsers to issue http requests and user the browser to get requested data back. 4) What is your TIL for this course section? I must say that all was ok for me for this course section. I have to improve my CSS,HTML and JAVASCRIPT

                <p>1) Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript? Yes little bit. As i said before, I made a client side web app for a a school project earlier. I had to connect to a remote server and do some CRUD operations. 2) Can you compare
                    and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know? I have learned Java so far and i think JavaScript is somehow like Java or c#. 3) Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did
                    your code turn out to be? I should say that i am not very happy with my coding. I think there is a lot of code repetition but i don't know how to make it better. I'm use to work with framework like Vuejs or React. It make everything easy.
                    Working from scratch like this is very good somehow because i think i learn a lot. But i just see that there are a lot of code duplication. A part from that i think proper coding was not that difficult yet. 4) What is your TIL for this
                    course section? I got to learn about transitions and animations. And I worked hard to reduce code duplication.

                <p>1) Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.? I have use Node and Npm(Node packet namager) with VueJs. 2) How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express? So far it is good. I think
                    it should be ok. 3) Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work? 4) What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level? 5) What is your TIL for this course section?

                <span>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</span><br /> Since i have no previous experience with PHP, it still a bit confusing. But it seems to be a very powerful language for dynamic websites. I think one just need to get use to it.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span>-Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</span><br /> So far i cannot see how to use PHP as an Object oriented language. That would be for me the major differnce.

            <h2>S06</h2>
            <p><strong>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</strong></p><br>
            <p>I think popularity among programming languages is quite subjective as it changing so fast nowaday. Some languages are more popular than other but at the end is a matter of preference. I really think it also depends on what you use the language for
                For example C will me more popular for game developer will Java or C# or Pyton or PHP will be more popular as server side language. Javascript will be popular in frondend developement. So i think the popularity is relative.
            </p><br>
            <p><strong>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</strong></p><br>
            <p>I just a beginner but i love javascript. So will definately go for Javascript in the future</p><br>
            <p><strong>Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com ,to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.</strong></p><br>
            <p>My comparison is that of JavaScript, PHP, Java. The results are parts of Europe such as Sweden, Norway, Brittain, France is the most popular language and in second place comes Java with and then the least is PHP not as popular as I thought
                it would be. Some countries like USA, Italy, Germany, China is most popular with Java. While the only country with PHP being popular is Indonesia, the rest of the world are very popular with JavaScript and Java both being around 40-50%
                each in these countries and PHP in the lesser than 10-20%.</p><br>
            <p><strong>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</strong></p>
            <p>It would definately be JavaScript as programming language. As i said before i love javascript. It's not the most simple language to learn but it's so powerful once you know. It's offer so many possibilities to bring live into your web applications. 
                I will recommend VueJs or React as framework. Personnaly i use VueJs because its quite simple to learn and it a good progressive language back up by big structures like Facebook,GitLab, Amazon...</p><br>

            <p><strong>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</strong><br>
                ASP.NET is a programming platform that provides a framework to many programming languages but more used for C#. The platform offers template for server side and client side web apps using MVC models.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</strong><br> .Net is very big and have alot of functionality. The MVC is implemented in both Express and .Net asp but asp is much nicer and userfriendly.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</strong><br> 
            I did not have much experience with .NET before but since C# is quite like Java, i could find my ways around after some reading and stackoverflow researchs. I could not do all parts because of lack of time. I Aim for a 4

            <h2>S09</h2>
            <p>Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, from your own experience, related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP top ten.</p>
            <p>In my past experiences in development of programs. I have learned that never to use statements but preparedstatements instead. Also making to hash and salt the user credentials for authentication to be kept safe. Then avoid having backdoors
                that people can abuse. So for these I would relate to OSAWP 10 are: Injections, Broken authentication, Broken access control. So in testing and debugging in deveolpment I usually make easier ways of accessing database and programs but
                these ways can be harmful for final product so to have it removed is necessary becuase they are not safe.</p>

            <p>Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic “The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”.</p>
            <p>To avoid leaving sensitive data available by separating development and testing and production, which require certain privilegies or log in credentials. Also backdoors for files and source code such as leaving a sensitive project available
                on GitHub for anyone to find public. There should be an administrator for handling the system and not give more privilegies than needed for a normal user. And make sure that the error logs dont give out certain credentials for instance,
                accessing the database. Then also to keep dependencies and tools updated to avoid security flaws. Such as using the latest JDBC for MySQL in Java.</p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>My TIL is understanding a bit more of security flaws precented and how serious it can be like for instance having financial issues from being attacked by hackers and the outcome that is may have on customers dependent on your service and might
                in the future not be a customer from reasons like these. For instance Reddit was hacked before and had their DB exposed and it was found out that all the passwords and usernames where not encrypted at all but just in plain text.</p>
